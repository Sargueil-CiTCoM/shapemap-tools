Shapemap Tools
==============
A set of tools to manage shapemap on RNA families.

## Library preparation
## GenTag 

separate repository - Generate Tag/Barcode RNA family performing a basic RNAfold folding to minimize risk of interaction between the Barcode and the RNA.


## Treatment
### Demultiplexing - Fastq-multx

```

```

### ShapeMapper Launcher




## Normalize By conditions

Wrapper around Shapemapper normalization script in order to easy normalize a RNA for all condition

## Aggregate replicates

Aggregate multiple replicate of a given condition for all RNA of a family, with divers statistics

## Generate structure

Wrapper around IPANEMAP in order to generate structure for each RNA of a family
